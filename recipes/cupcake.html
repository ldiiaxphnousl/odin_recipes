        <h2> Fufill your sweet craving with this delicious cupcake recipe! </h2>
        <p> Using the batter from my much loved Vanilla Cake, these Vanilla Cupcakes have a professional bakery-style crumb and stay perfectly moist for 4 whole days which is unheard of for cupcakes! </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> PLain Flour </li>
            <li> Eggs in room temperature </li>
            <li> Baking powder </li>
            <li> Full-fat milk </li>
            <li> Sugar </li>
            <li> Oil </li>
            <li> Vanilla extract </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Use a handheld beater and whisk the eggs and sugar </li>
            <li> Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. </li>
            <li> Gradually add the flour mixture into the egg mixture in 3 lots, mixing for just 5 seconds on Speed 1 in between. This should make the flour just incorporated – don’t worry if there are some streaks on the bowl not mixed in. Key here is minimum mixing! </li>
            <li> Melt butter and heat milk – use a microwave or stove to heat milk with the butter until it melts. HOT milk helps with rise for these cupcakes </li>
            <li> Mix some batter into hot milk (tempering) – this serves two purposes: a) bring down the temperature of the hot milk so it won’t “cook” the eggs (ie. tempering); and b) it lightens up the density of the hot milk (see above – it becomes foamy) so it blends together faster when added to the rest of the whipped egg mixture. Remember, minimal beating is key so we don’t knock out the cake-rising-bubbles we created in Step 2. </li>
            <li> Slowly pour milk mixture back into whipped eggs over 15 seconds while beating on the lowest speed. Scrape down sides of bowl, then mix for 10 seconds  – the batter should now be smooth; </li>
            <li> Fill cupcake liners with batter – I find the easiest way to do this is with an ice cream scoop with a lever. The standard size is 1/4 cup which is actually the perfect quantity for cupcakes! </li>
            <li> Bake 22 minutes until golden and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Let them rest for 2 minutes afterwards </li>
        </ol>
